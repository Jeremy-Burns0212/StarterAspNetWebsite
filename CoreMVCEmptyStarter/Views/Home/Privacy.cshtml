        <h2 style="margin-top:0;">1. Introduction</h2>
        <p style="margin:0 0 8px 0; color:#444;">
            Westfield Institute ("we", "our", "us") respects your privacy. This mock policy explains
            how information is hypothetically collected, used, and shared on our fictional platform.
            This document is provided for UI, legal layout, and development testing only.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Information We May Collect</h3>

        </ul>
    </section>

    <section style="margin-bottom:12px;">
        <h3>3. How We Use Information</h3>
        <p style="color:#444;">We (hypothetically) use collected information for:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Providing and personalizing services.</li>
            <li>Responding to support requests and communicating announcements.</li>
            <li>Analyzing usage to improve the site and demonstrate UI flows.</li>
            <li>Ensuring security and preventing abuse.</li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section style="margin-bottom:12px;">
        <h3>4. Cookies and Tracking</h3>
        <p style="color:#444; margin-bottom:6px;">This demo mentions common cookie behaviors used in real deployments:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> required for basic site functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics Cookies:</strong> aggregate anonymous usage data for product improvements.</li>
            <li><strong>Preference Cookies:</strong> remember display choices such as language or theme.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section style="margin-bottom:12px;">
        <h3>5. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h3>
        <p style="color:#444;">In a realistic scenario we may share information with service providers and partners
            who support site operations (e.g., hosting, analytics). All third-party relationships are
            governed by contracts and applicable privacy rules. This demo does not actually share any data.</p>
    </section>

    <section style="margin-bottom:12px;">
        <h3>6. Security</h3>
        <p style="color:#444;">We (would) use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect information
            from unauthorized access. However, no transmission over the internet is completely secure.
            This demo contains no sensitive data and is provided for presentation purposes only.</p>
    </section>

    <section style="margin-bottom:12px;">
        <h3>7. Data Retention</h3>
        <p style="color:#444;">In production, we retain information only as long as necessary to provide services and comply
            with legal obligations. For this sample site, all content is static mock data and not retained
            in any user-facing database.</p>
    </section>

    <section style="margin-bottom:12px;">
        <h3>8. Your Rights</h3>
        <p style="color:#444;">Depending on jurisdiction, real users may have rights such as access, correction,
            erasure, or portability of their personal data. This demo does not process real personal data,
            so these rights are not actionable here.</p>
    </section>

    <section style="margin-bottom:12px;">
        <h3>9. Children's Privacy</h3>
        <p style="color:#444;">The site is not intended for children under 13. We (would) not knowingly collect information
            from children without parental consent in a production environment.</p>
    </section>

    <section style="margin-bottom:12px;">
        <h3>10. Changes to This Policy</h3>
        <p style="color:#444;">If this were a live service, we would update the policy from time to time. Any material changes
            would be reflected on this page with an updated effective date.</p>
